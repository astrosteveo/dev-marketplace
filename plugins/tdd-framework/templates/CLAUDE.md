# TDD Framework

This project uses Test-Driven Development. Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

## Workflow

1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

## Natural Language Triggers

Just describe what you want naturally:

- **"Write tests for..."** or **"Test..."** → Red phase (write failing tests)
- **"Implement..."** or **"Make it pass"** → Green phase (minimal implementation)
- **"Refactor..."** or **"Clean up..."** → Refactor phase (improve without breaking)

## Rules

1. Never write implementation code without tests first
2. Write the simplest code that makes tests pass
3. Refactor only when tests are green
4. Each test should test one thing
