# Project Guidelines

## Workflow: Plan Before Code

This project uses Red-Green TDD. Before writing implementation code:

1. **Discuss** - Understand what we're building
2. **Plan** - Add a story to `## Active` in ROADMAP.md
3. **Test** - Write a failing test first
4. **Implement** - Make the test pass
5. **Complete** - Move story to done, clear Active

## Rules

- No implementation code without an active story in ROADMAP.md
- Tests are always allowed (write them first)
- One story at a time
