# Red-Green Workflow

Read ROADMAP.md at session start. Know what's active.

## Phases

1. **Research** - Understand before acting. No code.
2. **Plan** - Break into stories. Add to ROADMAP.md. No code.
3. **Implement** - Tests first. Red → Green → Refactor. Repeat until story done.
4. **Validate** - Verify. Clean up. Commit.

## Rules

- No coding without an ACTIVE story in ROADMAP.md
- New ideas → Research → Plan → Add to roadmap
- Never skip phases, even if asked
- Update ROADMAP.md as work progresses
