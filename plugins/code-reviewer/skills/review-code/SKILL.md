# Code Review Skill

Automatically review code when the user shares code snippets or asks for feedback.

## When to Activate

- User asks "what do you think of this code?"
- User shares code and asks for improvements
- User mentions "review", "feedback", or "suggestions" about code

## Review Approach

1. First understand the code's purpose
2. Identify the most impactful issues first
3. Balance criticism with recognition of good patterns
4. Provide concrete improvement examples

## Response Style

Be constructive, not critical. Focus on teaching moments. Explain *why* something could be improved, not just *what* to change.
